## Greatings!

I graduated from the Southwestern State University with a degree in specialized education - Software for computing equipment and automated systems.

I program in Java, 1C, SQL. 
My thesis was in Java. In it I used a database in MySQL.

Most of my projects are implemented on 1C.
I developed functionality for calculating incentive bonuses for employees of a large pig-breeding company.
Functionality for planning livestock sales in the same company.
I supported and corrected errors in the modified 1C:ERP Enterprise Management for a trade and manufacturing holding.
Achievements: Development and implementation of non-standard mechanisms on 8.2 and 8.3 for future updates. Refinement of data synchronization through "Data Conversion 2.0".
Development and implementation of specific accounting systems, their integration with the standard functionality of BP 3.0.

I’m currently learning Python and Machine Learning.

I want to upgrade neural networks so that they become more personalized, so that they understand the context of a specific person.
I am also interested in the issue of safety of using neural networks.

 My soft skills:
- Responsibility
- Attentiveness;
- Analytical thinking;
- Sociability;
- Perseverance;
- Stress resistance;
- Quick learning ability.
