## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from the Southwestern State University with a degree in specialized education - Software for computing equipment and automated systems.

I program in Java, 1C, SQL.

 Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Machine Learning.

 I want to upgrade neural networks so that they become more personalized, so that they understand the context of a specific person.
